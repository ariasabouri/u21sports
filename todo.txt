- Implement fontawesome icons
- Abstract all UI elements that are reusable into own components
- Migrate all components to the composition API using the setup syntax
- When break point at prices and other parts is reached, center the elements of the next line
- we moved the highlight section into an own component, remove all remaining CSS fragments in other components for the highlight section from them

Why does the coloring of the highlight section look completely different on each page?
1. The about-us page which was perfectly good before this prompt now shows the heading wrong (white text on white background)
2. Some pages show a dark background for this section, some a white. Make it configurable but the default values should be: white background, var(color-text-secondary) as text color
